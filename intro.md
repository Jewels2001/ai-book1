## What is "AI"?

AI is a very broad idea - a buzzword in its current use (especially since the release of ChatGPT continuing through now - Sept 2024). Ultimately, when people discuss artificial intelligence, they really mean *machine learning* algorithms. Now, this may change in the future if we are able to recreate human intelligence, but for now, our models only mimic parts of human expression and action. In other words, these articles take on the viewpoint that general artificial intelligence (a.k.a. artificial intelligence that mirrors human intelligence) is currently non-existent; artificial intelligence simply mirrors small parts of what the average human perceives to be intelligent. 


## Well then, what is "Machine Learning"?
Machine learning, albeit a bit less vague than the concept of "artificial intelligence", is still very much a buzzword within the media and general society. By itself, it is the idea that machines, or computers (1s and 0s/binary computations), are being used to "learn" predictions and inferences about the world. In reality, it is still debatable whether these algorithms are really *learning* anything in the same way that humans and other creatures "learn" concepts.
