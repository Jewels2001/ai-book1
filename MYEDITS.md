- First, an intro to AI
 1 - differences between supervised and unsupervised learning
 2 - introduction to agents
 3 - slight overview of applications of AI

Next steps...
 - focus in on types of models used within AI

 - scale from explainable to not explainable

 - object detection / CV
 - decision trees


Python!
 - have you used Python before?
 if not... tutorials!
 homework is to make fizzbuzz to learn the syntax and then make a plot with matplotlib


If you have...
pandas?
 ** tutorial needed

tensorflow?
 then go through tensorflow tutorial

scikit learn?
 * tutorial needed


Biggest thing with this "AI" is when you are talking about ML and not just AI, it becomes broader
 - so, steps are usually

 1 - find some problem you want solved or some question you want answered
 ex: my league example or CIUS
1.5 - define it clearly

 2 - Identify data sources 
 data is most important part of the models!

 3 - Collect and clean your data
 video/image data - blurry? resolution? size?
 text data - are you looking at words? phrases? what about misspellings?
 tabular data - missing values? what about incorrect values? human error?



SUPERVISED = pre-known target, data has labels
 - want to use ML to correctly predict the labels, so that when we have new data it can also predict the labels
UNSUPERVISED = no target, no labels



  - a bit of tabular data
  - a bit of image data
  - a bit of text data
